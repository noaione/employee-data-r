# Employee Attrition

A project for my data analysis class.

## Setup
You need this dependencies installed.
- `crayon`
- `ggplot2`

Install it with:
```r
install.packages("crayon")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

I also recommend install radian to execute the script line-by-line.

## Running

1. Make sure you're in the current directory of the repository
2. Open the `main.R`
3. Run everything line-by-line.
4. Execute the main function by calling `main()`
